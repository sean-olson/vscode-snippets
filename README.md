# VS Code Snippets

## About:
This collection of VS Code snippet-json resulted from frustration over having to re-create my snippets on each new platform I worked on.  This collection is not files is not exhaustive by any means.  I am continually appending new snippets, and if others find it useful, that's a good thing.  Please feel free to submit a PR for any snippets that you might share.

## Usage:
While crude, I choose to copy and paste the snippets into VS Code (as opposed to creating a VS Code extension) because it gives finer editorial control. Add them to your VS Code IDE: 

### On Mac:
1. Navigate to the snippets: Code > Settings > Configure User Snippets
2. Select the appropriate snippets file by keying the title in the textbox
3. Paste the snippets from the repository's corresponding file into the VS Code Snippets file, and edit to suit.

### On Windows:
1. Navigate to the snippets: Code > Preferences > Configure User Snippets
2. ... same as above.
